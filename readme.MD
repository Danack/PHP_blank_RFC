## Blank PHP RFC

If you looking for help for writing an RFC for PHP, you are in the right place.

Below are a suggested path of how to draft an RFC and start getting people interested in the idea. Although you are obviously free to also mail the PHP internals mailing list, if you first write enough words to docuement the proposal, it may produce a more productive conversation than merely emailing the internals list.

So my suggested path for having a productive RFC is:

1. Fork this repo, or just copy the blank_rfc.md file

2. Start writing words. Put enough detail for the proposal to be discussed. It's absolutely fine to leave lots of "not sure of the details here" notes. Having notes of what needs to be filled in, is the first step in filling them in. 

3. Ping me, either by opening an issue at https://github.com/Danack/PHP_blank_RFC, me on twitter (https://twitter.com/MrDanack), or anyone else who might be interested e.g. https://twitter.com/PHPRFCBot

4. Start listening to feedback, and either updating the doc, or at least creating issues in your own repo of stuff that still needs to be thought through.

5. When you feel the idea is good enough, either send it to the internals mailing list as is, or convert it to docuwiki and post it to https://wiki.php.net/rfc. Adding it to the wiki may require having wiki 'karma' aka permissions with a php.net account.
